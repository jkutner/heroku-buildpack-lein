# Heroku buildpack: Leiningen 

This is a [Heroku buildpack](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpack) for installing [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) but not running it. You probably don't need this, and should use the [offical Clojure buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-clojure) instead. This buildpack is primarily used to supplement the lein-heroku plugin.
